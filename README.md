# Awesome List of Dark Matter Papers

We believe there are certain dark matter papers that are worth reading for everyone in the field, or provide an excellent introduction to their subfields. 
The aim is to provide a *curated list* of these papers.
To clear up any confusion, this list does not necessarily need to contain the historically most influential papers. 
It may be the case that a subsequent paper builds on a previously introduced topic, making it more accessible and useful, thus making it into the list.

## We need your contributions!

This is a subjective list. We will try to avoid unconcious bias but removing it is impossible for anything *curated*.
As such we need help and contributions
If you have any suggestions (missing papers, typos, papers to remove) we want to hear them!
Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sliem/awesome-dark-matter-papers/blob/master/contribute.md) for futher instructions.

### Critera for inclusion

- Published in a scientific journal with a peer review process (For exceptional circumstances this criteria can be removed)
- Only one publication per major collaboration (i.e. results from the Planck collaboration) per subgroup, unless explicilty covering new material/results
- Each paper must introduce new content or summerize existing content
- No two papers can exclusively cover the same topic although there can be certain overlap
- Although we prefer to not add a constraint based on citations, the more the merrier

These are **flexible guidelines**, not strict rules.
