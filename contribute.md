# Contributing guide 

You can add / delete / modify the papers on the awesome list by directly editing the [README.md](https://github.com/sliem/awesome-dark-matter-papers/blob/master/README.md) file for contribution.
The prefered way to contribute is to fork the repository, make your edits, and then create a pull request.
If you don't know how to do this, you can instead create an [new issue](https://github.com/sliem/awesome-dark-matter-papers/issues) with your contribution.

## Critera for inclusion

- critera A
- critera B

These are **flexible guidelines**, if you have an argument for a paper not fulfilling the criteria please make it in the pull request.

## Addition

As mentioned above, please provide enough descriptions when you push a request, especially for the papers which do not meet the criteria.

Here is an example of markdown code for a paper on the list.

Distilling the knowledge in a neural network (2015), G. Hinton et al. \[[pdf]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531)

The pdf link which can directly download the pdf file rather than links to another webpage is preferred. If the number of authors are more than two, please write the first author's name only.

## Deletion

If a paper seems to be out-of-date or be a duplication of another paper, you can suggest deletion. Deletion is also an important contribution to maintain a tractable number of papers on the awesome list.

## Modification

Typical modifications:

* move papers from a section from another
* correction of typo, grammatical error, etc.

Note that you are not allowed to add or modify the sections. 
Instead please create an [new issue](https://github.com/sliem/awesome-dark-matter-papers/issues) arguing for the change and we will discuss it.
